# Text Named Entity Recognition

## Project Overview

This project showcases a Named Entity Recognition (NER) application built using spaCy, Streamlit, and spacy_streamlit. The application provides a user-friendly interface for performing word tokenization and named entity recognition on input text. By leveraging the power of spaCy's natural language processing capabilities, the app efficiently identifies and visualizes named entities within the text.

## Key Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The application is designed with simplicity in mind, ensuring ease of use for users with varying levels of technical expertise.
- **Real-Time Text Processing**: Users can input text directly into the app, which processes and visualizes the results in real-time.
- **Named Entity Recognition**: The app identifies and highlights named entities within the text, such as people, organizations, and locations.
- **Word Tokenization**: The app also offers word tokenization, breaking down the input text into individual tokens for detailed analysis.

## Technical Details

- **spaCy**: Utilized for its robust natural language processing capabilities, including tokenization and named entity recognition.
- **Streamlit**: Provides a streamlined and interactive web application framework, allowing for quick deployment and easy sharing of the app.
- **spacy_streamlit**: Enhances the visualization of spaCy's NLP models within the Streamlit application.

## How to Run

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Python and the required libraries installed (`spaCy`, `Streamlit`, and `spacy_streamlit`).
3. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
4. Execute the following command:
   ```
   streamlit run main.py
   ```
5. The Streamlit application will launch in your default web browser, ready for use.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the integration of spaCy's powerful NLP tools with Streamlit's interactive web framework to create an intuitive and functional NER application. It is an excellent example of how modern technologies can be combined to develop sophisticated yet user-friendly applications.
